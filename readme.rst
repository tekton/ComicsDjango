:Goal: To provide an easy way to keep track of comics, their relative ratings, library files and ownership.

There's a couple other versions of this I've worked on in the past, all in different languages. It's helped me to understand new tools since it's the same problem from a different angle.

At some point there will be installation instructions, just not today since it's still pre-alpha quality.

Django was chose due to its admin arena being great for rapid prototyping and python's small overhead and portability.
