:Goal: To provide an easy way to keep track of comics, their relative ratings, library files and ownership.

There's a couple other versions of this I've worked on in the past, all in different languages. It's helped me to understand new tools since it's the same problem from a different angle.

At some point there will be installation instructions, just not today since it's still pre-alpha quality.

Django was chose due to its admin arena being great for rapid prototyping and python's small overhead and portability.

apt notes
---------

Most development is done in ubuntu/mint, so to get started here's a couple things that may be missing.

``apt-get install libjpeg8-dev zlib1g-dev python3-dev``
